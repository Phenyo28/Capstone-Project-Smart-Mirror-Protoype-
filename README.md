# The Smart Mirror Prototype

This project is a Raspberry Piâ€“based interactive mirror designed to enhance personal grooming and self-care. The mirror integrates hardware (Pi, camera, LCD, LED lighting, two-way acrylic mirror) and software (Python, OpenCV, AR libraries) to provide an intelligent and engaging user experience.

With this smart mirror, users can:

Try on different hairstyles virtually using augmented reality overlays.

Experiment with makeup looks to preview styles before applying them.

Watch video tutorials or listen to music while getting ready.

Analyze skin and hair condition with the built-in camera and AI-based detection tools.
