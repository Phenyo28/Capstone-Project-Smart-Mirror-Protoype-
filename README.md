# The Smart Mirror Prototype

This project is a Smart Mirror Prototype, an interactive beauty and self-care device powered by a Raspberry Pi that transforms the traditional mirror into a smart assistant. It combines augmented reality (AR), computer vision, and AI-driven analysis. Designed to enhance daily routines at home or in salons, the smart mirror goes beyond reflection to provide a personalized, engaging, and practical self-care experience, with the potential to expand into additional features like reminders, scheduling, and smart home integration.

With this smart mirror, users can:
1. Try on different hairstyles virtually using augmented reality overlays.
2. Experiment with makeup looks to preview styles before applying them.
3. Watch video tutorials or listen to music while getting ready.
4. Analyze skin and hair condition with the built-in camera and AI-based detection tools.
