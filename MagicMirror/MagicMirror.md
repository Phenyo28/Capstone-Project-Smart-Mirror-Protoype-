## MagicMirror² Smart Mirror

MagicMirror² is an open-source modular smart mirror platform that displays customizable information on a mirror-like screen. This project allows users to integrate real-time data such as time, weather, calendar events, and news feeds, while also supporting advanced features like facial landmark detection and AR overlays. In my setup, I have added custom modules including a rotating globe to visualize the world, skin analysis and AR makeup overlays for interactive beauty applications, and a configuration system that can be automated to start on boot using PM2. The modular architecture makes it easy to add, remove, or adjust modules according to personal preferences. This repository documents my installation process, configuration details, and custom module implementations, providing a complete guide for a personalized and interactive smart mirror experience.
