## Skin Analysis Module – Smart Mirror Project
This folder contains the Skin Analysis feature of the Smart Mirror system.
The goal of this module is to analyze skin characteristics in real-time using a Raspberry Pi camera, OpenCV, and TensorFlow Lite.

This version is built without MediaPipe, using custom computer-vision techniques and optional TensorFlow Lite models for future ML upgrades.
